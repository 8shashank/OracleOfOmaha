##Team Communication

The team used a little bit of Slack as a beginning forms of communication but then resorted to emails to set up meeting times. The team met together for at least a couple of hours for multiple days and wrote most of the code as a group in the meetings.

##Bugs

We did not write a bugs.md file to keep track of the bugs since we were all working in a group and meeting together in person and whereever we found a bug, we worked on it together to fix it.
